# Experiments in Go

This is just a compilation of several basic experiments and prototypes for
upcoming projects in Golang. I'm going to be trying out a few basic things and
want to keep track of them for future reference.

The experiments will be separate and self-containing (no shared behaviour
between experiments) which will likely lead to duplication, but making clean
and maintainable dependencies isn't the point of this repo.

If you think I could do something better or implement something in a different
way; just [let me know](https://github.com/adlawson/golang-experiments/issues)
:+1:

If you think this repo is stupid; you're probably right.

If you think I'm stupid; you're definitely right.
